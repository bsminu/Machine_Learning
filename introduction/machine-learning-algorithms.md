### **Supervised Learning**

Supervised Learning is a technique of learning from examples. In supervised learning, you will have training data with labels. You will use the past/existing data to train the model. Once the model is ready, you will use the model to predict on new data.   


A typical example will be our Python class. During Saturday, I explained the concepts and showed a few examples. During weekdays, I gave assignments related to the concepts discussed. From the class experiences, you were able to solve the new problems by yourself.  


There are two types of Supervised learning techniques - Regression and Classification. Regression is used when the labels are continuous values and Classification is used when the labels are categorical.  




### **Unsupervised Learning**

In Unsupervised Learning, we donâ€™t know the outcome. This technique is mostly used in unstructured data like server logs, user feedback, Customer Segmentation, Spam email detection etc. Here, we try to group similar objects together. This is mainly used for identifying hidden patterns in the data.
